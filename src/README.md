#Rust Physics (2d) Tool Library
A library of 2d physics features (e.g. mathematical vectors) written for my own use in CodingGame bots, in rust.

It's a small library, not intended to neccessarily provide a complete physics suite, but will be updated with additional features on an as-needed basis.

#TODO
- Improve documentation substantiallys
